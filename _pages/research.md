  <strong>Abstract:</strong> The goal of this paper to obtain an isomorphism of categories that is the heart of a simple multiplicative functor from a category of operadic pseudoalgebras to a category of Segalic pseudoalgebras. This fits into a nonequivariant version of highly structured algebraic $K$-theory, from symmetric monoidal categories to orthogonal spectra. In particular, it gives a functor from symmetric bimonoidal categories to $E_\infty$ ring spectra.

**Unbiased Characterization of Symmetric Monoidal Categories**
<br> *with Kyle Roke, Jason Liu, and Hongyi Zhang*
<br> *UChicago REU 2025*
<br> **Status:** In final review process. <a href="mailto:kz105@wellesley.edu?subject=Request for draft: SymmMon">Draft available upon request by email.</a>

  <strong>Abstract:</strong> In this paper, we aim to provide a characterization of symmetric monoidal categories, identifying them as the natural inputs for the equivariant multiplicative infinite loop space machine developed in \cite{GMMO3}. Specifically, we give a self-contained proof of an equivalence between the category of symmetric monoidal categories and the category of $\PP$-pseudoalgebras, where $\PP$ is the categorical Barratt-Eccles operad. Unlike the previous approach by Yau \cite{Yau2}, we establish this equivalence without assuming normality of the operads or the corresponding categories. We construct explicit functors between these categories and demonstrate that they form an equivalence.
