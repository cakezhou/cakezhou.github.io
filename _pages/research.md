  <strong>Abstract:</strong> The goal of this paper to obtain an isomorphism of categories that is the heart of a simple multiplicative functor from a category of operadic pseudoalgebras to a category of Segalic pseudoalgebras. This fits into a nonequivariant version of highly structured algebraic $K$-theory, from symmetric monoidal categories to orthogonal spectra. In particular, it gives a functor from symmetric bimonoidal categories to $E_\infty$ ring spectra.

**Unbiased Characterization of Symmetric Monoidal Categories**
<br> *with Kyle Roke, Jason Liu, and Hongyi Zhang*
<br> *UChicago REU 2025*
<br> **Status:** <a href="mailto:kz105@wellesley.edu?subject=Request for draft: SymmMon"> PDF available upon request by email.</a>

  <strong>Abstract:</strong> In this paper, we aim to provide a characterization of symmetric monoidal categories, identifying them as the natural inputs for the equivariant multiplicative infinite loop space machine developed in \cite{GMMO3}. Specifically, we give a self-contained proof of an equivalence between the category of symmetric monoidal categories and the category of $\PP$-pseudoalgebras, where $\PP$ is the categorical Barratt-Eccles operad. Unlike the previous approach by Yau \cite{Yau2}, we establish this equivalence without assuming normality of the operads or the corresponding categories. We construct explicit functors between these categories and demonstrate that they form an equivalence.

**Entries of Bisymmetric Matrices and Their Spectra**
<br> *Advisor: John Urschel (MIT)*
<br> *MIT UROP 2024*
<br> **Status:** In final review process. <a href="mailto:kz105@wellesley.edu?subject=Request for draft: SymmMon">Draft available upon request by email.</a>

  <strong>Abstract:</strong> Bisymmetric matrices are n by n matrices that are both symmetric and centrosymmetric. Due to their structural symmetries, they are significant mathematical tools in the study of various linear algebra, computer science and quantum mechanics problems. In this work, we discuss the relations between the entries of bisymmetric tridiagonal matrices and their eigenvalues. In particular, we show that the entries can be written as rational functions of the eigenvalues explicitly. Applications of this finding include but are not restricted to partially proving the Rational Weights Conjecture.
