  <strong>Abstract:</strong> The goal of this paper to obtain an isomorphism of categories that is the heart of a simple multiplicative functor from a category of operadic pseudoalgebras to a category of Segalic pseudoalgebras. This fits into a nonequivariant version of highly structured algebraic $K$-theory, from symmetric monoidal categories to orthogonal spectra. In particular, it gives a functor from symmetric bimonoidal categories to $E_\infty$ ring spectra.
